# Python-Week-1
Introduction

Python is a programming language widely used for developing web applications, mobile applications, artificial intelligence and games. Python is known for being easiest to use compared to other programming languages. Python code can be writen on IDEs(Intergrated Development Environment) like Pycharm, Visual Studio Code and Sublime. It can be installed on a machine using the Python.org website.


# Variables and Types

Variables are basic unit of program, they are assigned a value which can store a piece of information temporarily. A variable beginning with a number can not be used, but mostly variables can begin with a lower case letter and have upper case letters or underscores. Unlike other programming languages, in Python a user does not have to specify a variable type, a variable can be declared an then assigned a value, the value assigned can be the one determining the variable type, to learn of the variable type in Python one can use the type(variableName) function and then run the code, after the code has been executed the terminal will return then variable type where there it is an int, char,float or string based on the value you assigned when declaring it.

# Data Structures

Data structures allow the storage of list values in a single variable. Types of data structures are Lists, Tuples, Sets and Dictionaries.

# Operators

Operators are instructions that perform operations on variables and values in Python. They are used to manapulate actions on data, there are Mathematical, Logical and Membership operators. Arithmetic operator is the operator that is used for mathematical calculations, these operators include addition(+), division(/), subtraction(-), and multiplication(*).

Comparison operator evaluate two variables or values and produce a boolean result either true or false.

Logical operators include "and", "or" and "not" can be used on boolean values. The "and" operator returns true only if both operands are true, "or" operator return true if at least one operand is true, "not" operator negates the boolean value it operates on.

Membership operators arenused to check if a number or string exists in a given list or string, "in" and "not in" are examples of logical operators.
